# Behavioral Design Patterns

This repository contains implementations of the common behavioral design patterns in Java, each demonstrating the pattern's purpose and usage.

## Patterns Included

1. **Chain of Responsibility:** Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
2. **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object.
3. **Interpreter:** Implements a grammar and interprets sentences.
4. **Iterator:** Provides a way to traverse a collection without exposing its structure.
5. **Mediator:** Defines an object that centralizes communication between objects.
6. **Memento:** Captures and restores an object's internal state.
7. **Observer:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
8. **State:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its state changes.
9. **Strategy:** Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.
10. **Template Method:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.
11. **Visitor:** Defines new operations on objects without changing their classes.
